            description: 'A diode is used to block the electric current flow in one direction, i.e. in forward direction and to block in reverse direction. This principle of diode makes it work as a Rectifier. ... A diode is also used as a Switch. It helps a faster ON and OFF for the output that should occur in a quick rate.',
